## How to use  

Every time the app refreshes, it queries  for cinematographic titles in the background. There are two main categories: *POPULAR* or *UPCOMING*, which are accessible from the buttom tab menu. The lists are scrollable and each item opens a detail page once clicked. Each detail page displays a poster, an user review, a short description, user reviews as well as a few popular trailers. The user is able to mark favorite titles by pressing *ADD* and then, those titles are automatically cached locally. Afterwards, the user is able to view them regardless of the network connection by pressing the *FAVORITES* option in the tab menu.

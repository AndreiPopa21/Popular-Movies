In the implementation of my project, I have used code from the following resources:
- the HTTP call is implemented in the same manner as the one from the Udacity Soonami App project (Android Networking course);
- the detail activity intent call and check was inspired by the code from the SandwichApp project (Udacity Android Developer Nanodegree);
